PCD8544 DATA SHEET

48x84 pixels matrix LCD controller/driver

8.1 Initialization
Immediately following power-on, the contents of all internal
registers and of the RAM are undefined. A RES pulse
must be applied. Attention should be paid to the
possibility that the device may be damaged if not properly
reset.
All internal registers are reset by applying an external RES
pulse (active LOW) at pad 31, within the specified time.
However, the RAM contents are still undefined. The state
after reset is described in Section 8.2.
The RES input must be =0.3VDD when VDD reaches VDDmin
(or higher) within a maximum time of 100 ms after VDD
goes HIGH (see Fig.16).
